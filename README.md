# Deep-Learning-Public-Data-Sets
Deep Learning Projects using public data sets.

This repository contains the following projects:
1. Titanic.ipynb:
   Use Titanic Data set from Kaggle for predicting survival/not survival of a passenger.
   Use Logistic Regression and DNN for solving the classification problem.
   More descriptions is in the top cell of the Jupyter Notebook.

2. bank_note.ipynb:
   Use public data set for predicting a bank note authenticate/not authenticate.
   Use DNN and Random Forest for solving the classification problem.
   More descriptions is in the top cell of Jupyter Notebook.

3. MNIST_DNN.ipynb:
   Use public available MNIST data set to predict hand-written digits.
   USE DNN with different numbers of unit and layer and different model
   (Tensorflow graph session, Keras) to solve the multi-class classfication problem.
   More descriptions is in the top cell of Jupyter Notebook.
